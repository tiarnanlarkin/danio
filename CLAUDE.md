# Danio Aquarium App

## IMPORTANT: Read Before Modifying

Before making ANY code changes, you MUST understand the area you're modifying. Read the relevant screen, provider, and model files first. Do not guess at architecture — this is a large app with 164 screens, 20 providers, 22 models, and 33 services.

If the user asks to modify a feature, explore the relevant files BEFORE proposing changes. Use the Explore agent or read files directly.

## IMPORTANT: Update This File After Feature Work

After completing any feature that adds new screens, providers, models, or services, UPDATE this CLAUDE.md file before the final commit. Add new entries to the relevant maps (Screen Map, Provider Map, Model Map) and update counts. This ensures the next session starts with accurate context.

A Stop hook will remind you if new .dart files were added to key directories.

## IMPORTANT: Workflow Guardrails

**Feature branches:** Before starting any new feature, create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/description`. Do NOT commit directly to `main` for new feature work. Only merge back via PR or explicit user request.

**One feature per session:** If the user asks about a completely different feature than what you've been working on, suggest starting a new session or using `/clear` first. Mixing unrelated features in one session leads to context pollution and mistakes.

**Session scope check:** If the session has been going for a long time with many changes, proactively suggest committing current work before starting new tasks. Say: "We've built a lot — want me to commit and push what we have before we continue?"

**Test before final commit:** Always run `flutter test` before the final commit of a feature. The git pre-commit hook runs `flutter analyze` automatically, but tests must be run explicitly.

**No broken windows:** If you encounter failing tests that are pre-existing, note them but do not ignore them. Flag them to the user and offer to fix.

## Theme System

12 room themes controlled by `roomThemeProvider`. Each theme has ~30 colour properties (waves, water, sand, plants, fish, glass, buttons, text). Themes carry across Learn, Practice, and Smart tabs via `ThemedTabHeader`.

Themes: ocean, pastel, sunset, midnight, forest, dreamy, watercolor, cotton, aurora, golden, cozyLiving, eveningGlow

Theme picker: stacked-card browser in a bottom sheet (`screens/home/theme_picker_sheet.dart`) with room background images + painted mini-aquarium overlay.

**When adding new themes:** Add to `RoomThemeType` enum, add static getter to `RoomTheme`, add WebP background to `assets/backgrounds/room-bg-{slug}.webp`, add header assets to `assets/images/headers/{tab}-header-{slug}.webp`.

## Learning System

- 14 learning paths with 44 lessons (lazy-loaded via deferred imports)
- Each lesson has sections (text, heading, keyPoint, tip, warning, funFact) and optional Quiz
- QuizQuestion has question text, 4 options, correctIndex, explanation
- Spaced repetition with 5 mastery levels (new -> learning -> familiar -> proficient -> mastered)
- Practice sessions use active MC and matching-pairs questions generated by `QuestionResolver`
- Strength: +0.2 correct, -0.3 incorrect. Interval scheduling: 1d -> 3d -> 7d -> 14d -> 30d

## Design System

Import `theme/app_theme.dart` for all design tokens (barrel exports `app_colors.dart`, `app_spacing.dart`, `app_typography.dart`, `app_radius.dart`).

- `AppColors` — Color palette with light/dark variants
- `AppSpacing` — Spacing scale (xxs through xl)
- `AppTypography` — Text styles (headlineLarge through bodySmall)
- `AppRadius` — Border radius presets
- `AppOverlays` — Semi-transparent overlay colours
- `context.textPrimary`, `context.surfaceColor`, etc. — Adaptive colour extensions
- `AppButton` with variants: primary, destructive, text
- `AppHaptics` — Haptic feedback (light, medium, selection, success, error)
- `showAppBottomSheet()`, `showAppDragSheet()`, `showAppScrollableSheet()` — Sheet primitives

## Key Conventions

- **Imports:** Use `package:danio/` for all internal imports
- **State:** Riverpod `StateNotifierProvider` pattern. Read with `ref.read()`, watch with `ref.watch()`
- **Persistence:** SharedPreferences for local prefs, Supabase for cloud data
- **Error handling:** `logError()` from `utils/logger.dart`, `DanioSnackBar.error()` for user-facing
- **Navigation:** `NavigationThrottle.push()` to prevent duplicate pushes, `AppRoutes` for named routes
- **Accessibility:** `Semantics` on interactive elements, `reducedMotionProvider` for animation preferences, WCAG AA contrast
- **Testing:** Widget tests in `test/widget_tests/`, unit tests in `test/models/` and `test/providers/`
- **Commits:** Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:)
- **Painters:** Custom painters live in `widgets/room/` (not a separate painters/ dir)

## Git

- Default branch: `main` (renamed from `openclaw/stage-system` on 2026-04-07 — see `docs/planning/2026-04-master-merge-strategy.md` for migration details)
- Old `master` branch is frozen, preserved as tag `master-archive-2026-04-07`
- Remote: `origin` → `https://github.com/tiarnanlarkin/danio.git`
- Always run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` before committing
- Feature branches branch off `main` and merge back via PR
